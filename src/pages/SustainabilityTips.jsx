            <p>
              Many years ago, I was an active little girl in church, and I remember singing one of my favourite songs that had a profound line: 
              <i> ‘Brighten the corner where you are, brighten the corner where you are…’ </i>
              It still is one of my favourite songs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, I sang it purely for the joy it brought (for the vibes), and because Teacher Zippy thought I was a decent singer whose voice needed to be heard. 
              Now that I'm an adult, an environmental engineer, a founder, I know for sure that there is a need to brighten the corner, right where I am. As a child, my response 
              to the ‘What would you like to be when you grow up?’ question was always, ‘A neurosurgeon.’ Why? Well, because my mother made me read 
              <i> ‘Gifted Hands’ </i> and <i> ‘Think Big’ </i> by Ben Carson, and because I wanted to change the world by treating people’s brains. Then, life happened, 
              and I didn’t pursue medicine. Instead, I pursued environmental engineering and still wanted to change the world by cleaning rivers, designing systems to recycle waste, 
              and to educate people about the essence of consuming responsibly. Then, I painfully realized that I cannot change the (whole) world, but I can 
              <b> ‘brighten this corner’ </b> through my work with Eco-Njia, by inspiring individuals, organizations, and myself, to live more mindfully and sustainably, by developing 
              sustainability strategies, simplifying science for public understanding, providing eco-friendly products, and waste recycling services.
            </p>
            <h2>Understanding Sustainability Concepts</h2>
            <p>
              Carbon sequestration. ESG. CSR. Carbon credits. Sustainability. What are all these things that everyone is talking about? SDG targets and indicators? 
              The Paris Agreement? What on God's green earth are these?
            </p>
            <p>
              For many reasons, the general public lacks an understanding of what these are and what their importance are. Although these are subjects that affect us all, 
              not much action has been taken to educate the masses. It is left to the leaders to figure out, for sustainability managers in organizations to determine. 
              Well, it is not important for everyone to know everything about everything, but it is important that everyone knows enough to do what is right, to ensure that 
              our activities now do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
            </p>
            <h2>Small Actions, Big Impacts</h2>
            <p>
              Sustainable living begins with the small, intentional choices we make daily. Whether it's switching to a reusable water bottle, opting for public transport, or 
              composting kitchen waste, these seemingly minor actions have ripple effects that extend far beyond individual households. When more people adopt these practices, 
              the cumulative environmental benefits become significant—less plastic in landfills, fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and a reduction in resource depletion. 
              Each small step creates momentum, inspiring others to make similar changes and contributing to a cultural shift toward sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
              The social impact of small actions is equally powerful. Supporting local businesses, reducing food waste, or volunteering in community clean-ups strengthens social 
              bonds and fosters collective responsibility. For example, initiatives like Eco-Njia's children’s program in Kibera and Githurai show how small acts, such as children 
              collecting and recycling plastic waste, can teach invaluable lessons about environmental stewardship while improving community conditions. These efforts, though simple, 
              create lasting change by empowering individuals and communities to take ownership of their surroundings. Every small step contributes to a broader movement, reminding us that 
              sustainability is a shared journey where every action matters.
            </p>
